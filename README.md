About my project:

Description:  In this analysis, we delve into the intricate patterns of customer behavior stemming from apartments in Germany. By collating and studying various data points, including rental histories, tenant feedback, and amenity usage, we aim to uncover insights that can help property managers, real estate developers, and marketers better understand the preferences and needs of their clientele. This study not only sheds light on the current trends and preferences of German apartment dwellers but also offers actionable insights that can be leveraged to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize marketing strategies, and drive occupancy rates.

Result: Improve service and customer satisfaction in the apartment, with a target of a total annual rental rate of 15% within every year.

Technology / Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn,and Tableau.
